# Title: Classification of Alzheimer's disease of the ADNI brain data using a Siamese Network.

# Description of Algorithm: 
A Siamese network consists of two identical neural networks, each of which takes in one of two
input images. The outputs of the networks are feature vectors which are then fed into a contrastive
loss function, which calculates the similarities between the two images. The main objective of an SNN is to differentiate between two images.

for Binary classification, feature vector is fed into a sigmoid function
